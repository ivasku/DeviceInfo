# DeviceInfo

Free Android app that displays Device information like system RAM, storage, Android system information and other parameters of the device.

No ads, no hidden tracking/metrics. 

I needed a simple information app that doens t bother me with ads, with a milion of user colecting metrics and other stuff.

Lightweigt to the device, simple and to the point.
